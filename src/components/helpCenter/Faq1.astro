    question: "Do I need a design or development background?",

  },
  {
    question: "What tools will I need?",
    answer:
      "You’ll need Figma (or a design tool you’re comfortable with), a code editor like VS Code, and a modern browser. We’ll guide you through everything else step-by-step.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this up to date with current design system practices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The course is regularly updated to reflect current best practices in design systems, component libraries, and frontend tooling.",
