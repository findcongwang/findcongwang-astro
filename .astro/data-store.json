sense. The content collections module was the breakthrough I needed. Everything was clear, well-paced, and actually fun to follow. I went from confused to confident in under two hours.\n","## From Framework Confusion to Content Mastery\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Student Profile:**\r\n- **Name:** Sofia Lundarez\r\n- **Location:** Barcelona, Spain\r\n- **Role:** Frontend Developer Intern\r\n- **Course:** Astro Content Collections\r\n- **Duration:** 2 hours\r\n- **Experience Level:** Junior Developer\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nSofia Lundarez, a frontend developer intern from Barcelona, transformed her approach to content-driven web development through the Astro Content Collections course. In just two hours, she progressed from framework confusion to leading a documentation migration project at her internship—demonstrating the immediate practical impact of structured learning.\r\n\r\n## The Challenge: Framework Paralysis\r\n\r\n### Initial Situation\r\nSofia entered the course experiencing a common developer challenge: **framework paralysis**.

We'll walk through the folder structure, configuration, and create some sample content to get you started.\r\n\r\n## What You'll Learn\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, you'll learn:\r\n\r\n- How to structure the `src/content/` directory\r\n- Creating your first collection configuration\r\n- Adding content files to your collection\r\n- Basic collection querying and display\r\n\r\n## Creating the Content Directory\r\n\r\nFirst, create the `src/content/` directory in your Astro project. This is where all your collections will live.\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/\r\n├── content/\r\n│   ├── blog/\r\n│   ├── projects/\r\n│   └── config.ts\r\n├── pages/\r\n└── components/\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach subdirectory represents a different collection. For this example, we'll create a blog collection.\r\n\r\n## Configuring Your Collection\r\n\r\nCreate `src/content/config.ts` to define your collections:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { defineCollection, z } from \"astro:content\";\r\n\r\nconst blog = defineCollection({\r\n  type: \"content\",\r\n  schema: z.object({\r\n    title: z.string(),\r\n    description: z.string(),\r\n    pubDate: z.date(),\r\n    author: z.string(),\r\n    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),\r\n  }),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport const collections = {\r\n  blog,\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis configuration tells Astro that you have a `blog` collection with specific frontmatter requirements.\r\n\r\n## Adding Content Files\r\n\r\nCreate your first blog post at `src/content/blog/first-post.md`:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntitle: \"My First Blog Post\"\r\ndescription: \"Learning about Astro Content Collections\"\r\npubDate: 2025-06-15\r\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\r\ntags: [\"astro\", \"webdev\"]\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Welcome to My Blog\r\n\r\nThis is my first post using Astro Content Collections!\r\n\r\nContent Collections make it easy to manage and organize content at scale.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Querying Your Collection\r\n\r\nNow you can query your collection in any Astro page. Create `src/pages/blog.astro`:\r\n\r\n```astro\r\n---\r\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\r\n\r\nconst blogPosts = await getCollection('blog');\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003Chtml lang=\"en\">\r\n  \u003Chead>\r\n    \u003Ctitle>My Blog\u003C/title>\r\n  \u003C/head>\r\n  \u003Cbody>\r\n    \u003Ch1>Blog Posts\u003C/h1>\r\n    {blogPosts.map(post => (\r\n      \u003Carticle>\r\n        \u003Ch2>{post.data.title}\u003C/h2>\r\n        \u003Cp>{post.data.description}\u003C/p>\r\n        \u003Ctime>{post.data.pubDate.toDateString()}\u003C/time>\r\n      \u003C/article>\r\n    ))}\r\n  \u003C/body>\r\n\u003C/html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n\r\n- **Automatic Discovery**: Astro finds all `.md` files in your collection directories\r\n- **Type Safety**: The schema validates your frontmatter at build time\r\n- **Easy Querying**: Use `getCollection()` to retrieve all entries from a collection\r\n- **Data Access**: Content metadata is available through `post.data`, content through `post.body`\r\n\r\nYour Content Collection is now ready! In the next lesson, we'll explore how to create more complex schemas with validation and custom data types.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\n// Import content utilities\r\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\r\nimport Layout from '@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\r\nimport BlogCard from '@/components/BlogCard.astro';\r\n\r\nconst posts = await getCollection('blog');\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\r\n\u003CLayout>\r\n  \u003Csection class=\"py-12\">\r\n    \u003Ch1 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-primary\">Latest Posts\u003C/h1>\r\n    \u003Cul class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6\">\r\n      {posts.map((post) => (\r\n        \u003Cli>\r\n          \u003CBlogCard\r\n            title={post.data.title}\r\n            description={post.data.description}\r\n            date={post.data.pubDate}\r\n            href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}\r\n          />\r\n        \u003C/li>\r\n      ))}\r\n    \u003C/ul>\r\n  \u003C/section>\r\n\u003C/Layout>\r\n\r\n\u003Cstyle>\r\n  section {\r\n    --tw-prose-body: theme('colors.zinc.800');\r\n    background: theme('colors.white');\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\r\n    section {\r\n      --tw-prose-body: theme('colors.zinc.100');\r\n      background: theme('colors.zinc.900');\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\u003C/style>\r\n```","src/content/lessons/astro-content-collections/setting-up-collections.md","ed39d96357013af4",{"html":1201,"metadata":1202},"\u003Cp>Now that you understand what Content Collections are, let’s create your first collection.

Up Your First Astro Project","05:18","astro-fundamentals","# Setting Up Your First Astro Project\r\n\r\nNow that you understand what Astro is and why it's powerful, it's time to get your hands dirty and create your first Astro project. In this lesson, we'll walk through the entire setup process, explore the project structure, and make your first changes to see Astro in action.\r\n\r\n## What You'll Learn\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, you'll learn:\r\n- How to install Astro and create a new project\r\n- Understanding Astro's project structure and key files\r\n- Running the development server and making your first changes\r\n- Basic configuration options and customization\r\n- How to add your first page and component\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nBefore we begin, make sure you have:\r\n- Node.js version 18 or higher installed\r\n- A code editor (VS Code recommended)\r\n- Basic familiarity with the command line\r\n- Understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals\r\n\r\n## Creating Your First Astro Project\r\n\r\n### Using the Astro CLI\r\n\r\nThe fastest way to create an Astro project is using the official create-astro command. This interactive tool will guide you through the setup process and let you choose from several starter templates.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm create astro@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CLI will ask you several questions:\r\n- **Project name**: Choose a descriptive name for your project\r\n- **Template**: Select from minimal, blog, portfolio, or other starter templates\r\n- **TypeScript**: Whether to use TypeScript (recommended for larger projects)\r\n- **Dependencies**: Whether to install dependencies automatically\r\n- **Git repository**: Whether to initialize a Git repository\r\n\r\nFor your first project, we recommend starting with the \"minimal\" template to understand Astro's core concepts without additional complexity.\r\n\r\n### Alternative Installation Methods\r\n\r\nYou can also specify options directly in the command:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# Create with specific template\r\nnpm create astro@latest my-astro-site -- --template minimal\r\n\r\n# Create with TypeScript\r\nnpm create astro@latest my-astro-site -- --template minimal --typescript\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing Dependencies\r\n\r\nIf you didn't install dependencies during setup, navigate to your project folder and run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd my-astro-site\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Understanding the Project Structure\r\n\r\nOnce your project is created, you'll see a folder structure that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy-astro-site/\r\n├── public/\r\n│   └── favicon.svg\r\n├── src/\r\n│   ├── components/\r\n│   ├── layouts/\r\n│   └── pages/\r\n│       └── index.astro\r\n├── astro.config.mjs\r\n├── package.json\r\n├── tsconfig.json\r\n└── README.md\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Key Directories and Files\r\n\r\n**`src/` Directory**\r\nThis is where all your source code lives. Everything in here gets processed by Astro during the build process.\r\n\r\n**`src/pages/`**\r\nThis directory contains your website's pages. Astro uses file-based routing, meaning each file in this directory becomes a route on your website. The `index.astro` file becomes your homepage at `/`.\r\n\r\n**`src/components/`**\r\nReusable Astro components go here. These are building blocks you can use across multiple pages to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\r\n\r\n**`src/layouts/`**\r\nLayout components that wrap your pages go here. Layouts are perfect for shared elements like headers, footers, and navigation that appear across multiple pages.\r\n\r\n**`public/` Directory**\r\nStatic assets that don't need processing go here. Files in this directory are served directly by the web server. This includes images, fonts, favicon, robots.txt, and other static files.\r\n\r\n**`astro.config.mjs`**\r\nThe main configuration file for your Astro project. Here you can configure integrations, build options, server settings, and more.\r\n\r\n**`package.json`**\r\nContains your project's metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts. This is standard for any Node.js project.\r\n\r\n## Running Your Development Server\r\n\r\nTo start the development server and see your site in action:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nnpm run dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command starts a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:4321`. The server includes:\r\n- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Changes you make are instantly reflected in the browser\r\n- **Error Overlay**: Helpful error messages displayed directly in the browser\r\n- **Fast Refresh**: Quick reloading without losing application state\r\n\r\n### Available Scripts\r\n\r\nYour `package.json` includes several useful scripts:\r\n\r\n- `npm run dev`: Start the development server\r\n- `npm run build`: Build your site for production\r\n- `npm run preview`: Preview your production build locally\r\n- `npm run astro`: Run Astro CLI commands directly\r\n\r\n## Making Your First Changes\r\n\r\n### Editing the Homepage\r\n\r\nOpen `src/pages/index.astro` in your code editor. You'll see an Astro component that looks similar to HTML but with some special features:\r\n\r\n```astro\r\n---\r\n// Component frontmatter (JavaScript)\r\n---\r\n\r\n\u003Chtml lang=\"en\">\r\n  \u003Chead>\r\n    \u003Cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" />\r\n    \u003Clink rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/favicon.svg\" />\r\n    \u003Cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" />\r\n    \u003Cmeta name=\"generator\" content={Astro.generator} />\r\n    \u003Ctitle>Astro\u003C/title>\r\n  \u003C/head>\r\n  \u003Cbody>\r\n    \u003Ch1>Astro\u003C/h1>\r\n  \u003C/body>\r\n\u003C/html>\r\n```","src/content/lessons/astro-fundamentals/setting-up-your-first-project.md","67b637968345da35",{"html":1235,"metadata":1236},"\u003Ch1 id=\"setting-up-your-first-astro-project\">Setting Up Your First Astro Project\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Now that you understand what Astro is and why it’s powerful, it’s time to get your hands dirty and create your first Astro project.
