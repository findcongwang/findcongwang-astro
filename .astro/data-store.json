They provide a type-safe, structured way to work with Markdown files, making them perfect for blogs, documentation, portfolios, and any content-heavy website.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lesson, you'll discover:\n- What Content Collections are and why they're powerful\n- How they differ from regular Markdown files in Astro\n- The benefits of type-safe content management\n- When to use Content Collections in your projects\n\n## What Are Content Collections?\n\nContent Collections transform your Markdown files from simple static content into a powerful, queryable database. Instead of manually importing each Markdown file, Astro automatically discovers and processes all content in your collections, providing type safety and validation out of the box.\n\nThink of Content Collections as your content's API layer - they give you a consistent, predictable way to access and manipulate your content across your entire site.\n\n## Key Benefits\n\n**Type Safety**: Define schemas for your content's frontmatter, catching errors at build time rather than runtime.\n\n**Automatic Discovery**: Astro automatically finds and processes all files in your collection directories.\n\n**Powerful Querying**: Filter, sort, and search your content with built-in helper functions.\n\n**Validation**: Ensure your content follows consistent structure and format rules.\n\n**Performance**: Content is processed at build time, resulting in faster page loads.\n\n## Collections vs Regular Markdown\n\nRegular Markdown files in Astro work great for simple pages, but Content Collections shine when you have:\n- Multiple pieces of similar content (blog posts, products, team members)\n- Structured data that needs validation\n- Content that requires filtering or sorting\n- Large amounts of content that need organization\n\n## Real-World Use Cases\n\nContent Collections are perfect for:\n- **Blogs**: Posts with categories, tags, publication dates, and author information\n- **Portfolios**: Projects with descriptions, technologies used, and showcase images  \n- **Documentation**: Guides with hierarchical organization and cross-references\n- **Product Catalogs**: Items with prices, specifications, and categories\n- **Team Pages**: Member profiles with roles, bio, and contact information\n\n## Getting Started\n\nContent Collections live in the `src/content/` directory and are defined in `src/content/config.ts`.

Its unique island architecture allows developers to build websites using their favorite components — whether from React, Vue, Svelte, or others — without sacrificing performance.\n\nUnlike traditional SPA frameworks, Astro focuses on static-first delivery, meaning your pages render as HTML by default and only hydrate interactive components when needed. This makes it ideal for content-heavy websites like blogs, marketing sites, documentation, and portfolios.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn:\n- The core philosophy behind Astro\n- Why Astro is different from other frontend tools\n- The types of projects Astro is best suited for\n- How Astro's performance model benefits the end user\n\n## The Astro Philosophy\n\nAstro is built around several key principles that distinguish it from other web frameworks:\n\n### Less JavaScript, More Performance\nTraditional single-page applications (SPAs) ship entire JavaScript bundles to the browser, even for static content. Astro takes a different approach by rendering pages to static HTML at build time and only adding JavaScript where it's actually needed. This results in faster page loads, better SEO, and improved user experience across all devices.\n\n### Islands Architecture\nAstro pioneered the \"islands architecture\" pattern, where interactive components exist as isolated islands of interactivity within a sea of static HTML. Each island can use different frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) and only loads JavaScript when the component needs to be interactive. This means you can have a React component for your navigation, a Vue component for your contact form, and a Svelte component for your image gallery—all on the same page.","src/content/archived/lessons/astro-fundamentals/what-is-astro.md","caff2f4167444579",{"html":1191,"metadata":1192},"\u003Ch1 id=\"what-is-astro\">What is Astro?\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Astro is a modern static site generator that delivers lightning-fast performance by default by shipping less JavaScript to the browser.

In this lesson, we'll walk through the entire setup process, explore the project structure, and make your first changes to see Astro in action.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn:\n- How to install Astro and create a new project\n- Understanding Astro's project structure and key files\n- Running the development server and making your first changes\n- Basic configuration options and customization\n- How to add your first page and component\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore we begin, make sure you have:\n- Node.js version 18 or higher installed\n- A code editor (VS Code recommended)\n- Basic familiarity with the command line\n- Understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals\n\n## Creating Your First Astro Project\n\n### Using the Astro CLI\n\nThe fastest way to create an Astro project is using the official create-astro command. This interactive tool will guide you through the setup process and let you choose from several starter templates.\n\n```bash\nnpm create astro@latest\n```\n\nThe CLI will ask you several questions:\n- **Project name**: Choose a descriptive name for your project\n- **Template**: Select from minimal, blog, portfolio, or other starter templates\n- **TypeScript**: Whether to use TypeScript (recommended for larger projects)\n- **Dependencies**: Whether to install dependencies automatically\n- **Git repository**: Whether to initialize a Git repository\n\nFor your first project, we recommend starting with the \"minimal\" template to understand Astro's core concepts without additional complexity.\n\n### Alternative Installation Methods\n\nYou can also specify options directly in the command:\n\n```bash\n# Create with specific template\nnpm create astro@latest my-astro-site -- --template minimal\n\n# Create with TypeScript\nnpm create astro@latest my-astro-site -- --template minimal --typescript\n```\n\n### Installing Dependencies\n\nIf you didn't install dependencies during setup, navigate to your project folder and run:\n\n```bash\ncd my-astro-site\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Understanding the Project Structure\n\nOnce your project is created, you'll see a folder structure that looks like this:\n\n```\nmy-astro-site/\n├── public/\n│   └── favicon.svg\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   ├── layouts/\n│   └── pages/\n│       └── index.astro\n├── astro.config.mjs\n├── package.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Key Directories and Files\n\n**`src/` Directory**\nThis is where all your source code lives. Everything in here gets processed by Astro during the build process.\n\n**`src/pages/`**\nThis directory contains your website's pages. Astro uses file-based routing, meaning each file in this directory becomes a route on your website. The `index.astro` file becomes your homepage at `/`.\n\n**`src/components/`**\nReusable Astro components go here. These are building blocks you can use across multiple pages to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n\n**`src/layouts/`**\nLayout components that wrap your pages go here. Layouts are perfect for shared elements like headers, footers, and navigation that appear across multiple pages.\n\n**`public/` Directory**\nStatic assets that don't need processing go here. Files in this directory are served directly by the web server. This includes images, fonts, favicon, robots.txt, and other static files.\n\n**`astro.config.mjs`**\nThe main configuration file for your Astro project. Here you can configure integrations, build options, server settings, and more.\n\n**`package.json`**\nContains your project's metadata, dependencies, and npm scripts. This is standard for any Node.js project.\n\n## Running Your Development Server\n\nTo start the development server and see your site in action:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis command starts a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:4321`. The server includes:\n- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Changes you make are instantly reflected in the browser\n- **Error Overlay**: Helpful error messages displayed directly in the browser\n- **Fast Refresh**: Quick reloading without losing application state\n\n### Available Scripts\n\nYour `package.json` includes several useful scripts:\n\n- `npm run dev`: Start the development server\n- `npm run build`: Build your site for production\n- `npm run preview`: Preview your production build locally\n- `npm run astro`: Run Astro CLI commands directly\n\n## Making Your First Changes\n\n### Editing the Homepage\n\nOpen `src/pages/index.astro` in your code editor. You'll see an Astro component that looks similar to HTML but with some special features:\n\n```astro\n---\n// Component frontmatter (JavaScript)\n---\n\n\u003Chtml lang=\"en\">\n  \u003Chead>\n    \u003Cmeta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    \u003Clink rel=\"icon\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" href=\"/favicon.svg\" />\n    \u003Cmeta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width\" />\n    \u003Cmeta name=\"generator\" content={Astro.generator} />\n    \u003Ctitle>Astro\u003C/title>\n  \u003C/head>\n  \u003Cbody>\n    \u003Ch1>Astro\u003C/h1>\n  \u003C/body>\n\u003C/html>\n```","src/content/archived/lessons/astro-fundamentals/setting-up-your-first-project.md","ae84ac90e7b3624b",{"html":1220,"metadata":1221},"\u003Ch1 id=\"setting-up-your-first-astro-project\">Setting Up Your First Astro Project\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>Now that you understand what Astro is and why it’s powerful, it’s time to get your hands dirty and create your first Astro project.

up Collections","Now that you understand what Content Collections are, let's create your first collection. We'll walk through the folder structure, configuration, and create some sample content to get you started.\n\n## What You'll Learn\n\nIn this lesson, you'll learn:\n\n- How to structure the `src/content/` directory\n- Creating your first collection configuration\n- Adding content files to your collection\n- Basic collection querying and display\n\n## Creating the Content Directory\n\nFirst, create the `src/content/` directory in your Astro project. This is where all your collections will live.\n\n```\nsrc/\n├── content/\n│   ├── blog/\n│   ├── projects/\n│   └── config.ts\n├── pages/\n└── components/\n```\n\nEach subdirectory represents a different collection. For this example, we'll create a blog collection.\n\n## Configuring Your Collection\n\nCreate `src/content/config.ts` to define your collections:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineCollection, z } from \"astro:content\";\n\nconst blog = defineCollection({\n  type: \"content\",\n  schema: z.object({\n    title: z.string(),\n    description: z.string(),\n    pubDate: z.date(),\n    author: z.string(),\n    tags: z.array(z.string()).optional(),\n  }),\n});\n\nexport const collections = {\n  blog,\n};\n```\n\nThis configuration tells Astro that you have a `blog` collection with specific frontmatter requirements.\n\n## Adding Content Files\n\nCreate your first blog post at `src/content/blog/first-post.md`:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: \"My First Blog Post\"\ndescription: \"Learning about Astro Content Collections\"\npubDate: 2025-06-15\nauthor: \"Your Name\"\ntags: [\"astro\", \"webdev\"]\n---\n\n# Welcome to My Blog\n\nThis is my first post using Astro Content Collections!\n\nContent Collections make it easy to manage and organize content at scale.\n```\n\n## Querying Your Collection\n\nNow you can query your collection in any Astro page. Create `src/pages/blog.astro`:\n\n```astro\n---\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\n\nconst blogPosts = await getCollection('blog');\n---\n\n\u003Chtml lang=\"en\">\n  \u003Chead>\n    \u003Ctitle>My Blog\u003C/title>\n  \u003C/head>\n  \u003Cbody>\n    \u003Ch1>Blog Posts\u003C/h1>\n    {blogPosts.map(post => (\n      \u003Carticle>\n        \u003Ch2>{post.data.title}\u003C/h2>\n        \u003Cp>{post.data.description}\u003C/p>\n        \u003Ctime>{post.data.pubDate.toDateString()}\u003C/time>\n      \u003C/article>\n    ))}\n  \u003C/body>\n\u003C/html>\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n- **Automatic Discovery**: Astro finds all `.md` files in your collection directories\n- **Type Safety**: The schema validates your frontmatter at build time\n- **Easy Querying**: Use `getCollection()` to retrieve all entries from a collection\n- **Data Access**: Content metadata is available through `post.data`, content through `post.body`\n\nYour Content Collection is now ready! In the next lesson, we'll explore how to create more complex schemas with validation and custom data types.\n\n```yaml\n---\n// Import content utilities\nimport { getCollection } from 'astro:content';\nimport Layout from '@/layouts/BaseLayout.astro';\nimport BlogCard from '@/components/BlogCard.astro';\n\nconst posts = await getCollection('blog');\n---\n```\n\n```html\n\n\u003CLayout>\n  \u003Csection class=\"py-12\">\n    \u003Ch1 class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-primary\">Latest Posts\u003C/h1>\n    \u003Cul class=\"grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mt-6\">\n      {posts.map((post) => (\n        \u003Cli>\n          \u003CBlogCard\n            title={post.data.title}\n            description={post.data.description}\n            date={post.data.pubDate}\n            href={`/blog/${post.slug}`}\n          />\n        \u003C/li>\n      ))}\n    \u003C/ul>\n  \u003C/section>\n\u003C/Layout>\n\n\u003Cstyle>\n  section {\n    --tw-prose-body: theme('colors.zinc.800');\n    background: theme('colors.white');\n  }\n\n  @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {\n    section {\n      --tw-prose-body: theme('colors.zinc.100');\n      background: theme('colors.zinc.900');\n    }\n  }\n\u003C/style>\n```","src/content/archived/lessons/astro-content-collections/setting-up-collections.md","147808aaf066f504",{"html":1271,"metadata":1272},"\u003Cp>Now that you understand what Content Collections are, let’s create your first collection.
